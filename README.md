# Coding Quiz Code
Written by Forrest Faulkner for Vanderbilt Full Stack Web Development course 2020

Displays a quiz about the fundamentals of JavaScript, grading based on time remaining on the 75 second clock. Incorrect answers will subtract 15 seconds, and after either the timer finishes, or all questions are answered, the score will be displayed, and the user will be able to input a name which will be stored to localStorage to keep track of high scores, which will be displayed as soon as the user submits their score. Only the top 10 scores are stored, and they're sorted primarily by score, then by when they were achieved, older scores being higher.
